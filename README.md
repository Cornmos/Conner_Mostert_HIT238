# Conner_Mostert_HIT238
 Application design for HIT238
Basic structure and functionality implemented in MVP with data being saved in JSON format. Information upload to Server hosting database is still required in future design. More HTML and CSS to be added later to improve the apearance of the App
The current code only covers the Client side of the application. Server side Javascript is still required to fetch the data, manage and store the Data.
