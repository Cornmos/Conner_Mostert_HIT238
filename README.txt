# Conner_Mostert_HIT238
 Application design for HIT238
Basic structure and functionality implemented in MVP with data being saved in JSON format. Information upload to Server hosting database is still required in future design. More HTML and CSS to be added later to improve the apearance of the App. 
The current code only covers the Client side of the application. Server side Javascript is still required to fetch the data, manage and store the Data.

Dependancies:
fs (npm install fs): file manager to allow saving to the database from the server
express (npm install express): Allow comunication between client and server.

Node:
To run server open powershell in the folder location> command: node Index.js> this will start the server and show which port it is broadcasting from
In your browser search: 127.0.0.1:3000> 3000 is the port the server is currently broadcasting from.
